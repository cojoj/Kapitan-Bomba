Kapitan-Bomba
=============

These are the two projects created on [Hack KRK](http://hackkrk.com). Title of this meeting was **Connectivity**, so we've decided to
create iOS app which is using `CoreBluetooth`.    
Maybe this app is not very useful and briliant but it was a great opportunity for us to exlplore something new and gain some experience.

It is devided into two pieces:
* **Broadcaster**
* **Receiver**  
  
And here is the story which lays behind this project:
---
Long, long time ago there was a forbidden Universe called Kurvix which was protected by **Kapitan Bomba**. He was protecting this Universe from many creepy creature... One of them was **Skurwol** which was pretty annoying for the Kapitan. But in Kurvix there was a weapon of mass destruction... So every time a Skurwol was getting near the Universe Kapitan was killing it and counting these poor losers.

Kapitan-Bomba
=============

These are the two projects created on [Hack KRK](http://hackkrk.com). Title of this meeting was **Connectivity**, so we decided to
create iOS app which is using `CoreBluetooth`.    

It is devided into two pieces:
1. **Broadcaster**
2. **Receiver**  
  
And here is the story which lays behind this project:
==============
Long, long time ago there was a forbidden Universe called Kurvix which was protected by **Kapitan Bomba**. He was protecting this Universe from many creepy creature... One of them was **Skurwol** which was pretty annoying for Kapitan. But in Kurvix there was a weapon of mass destruction, so every time a Skurwol was getting near the Universe Kapitan wass kelling it and counting these poor losers.
